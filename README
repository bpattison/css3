css3 is css3 parser for Clojure developed using Joshua Choi's FnParser. This current version implements most, but not all of the CSS3 specification. A more complete version of CSS3 may developed if there's interest in the parser.

css3 depends on FnParser, clojure-contrib, and clojure.

css3's distribution has src and test folders. To use css3, download this
distribution and make sure you have the following on your class path.

  java -cp $CLOJURE_PATH:clojure-contrib.jar:FnParse.jar:css3.jar

css3's namespace is 'parser.css3'

css3's unit tests are stored in the tests folder.

"make.sh" is an example script to run ant to build "css3.jar". The paths to clojure, clojure-contrib, and FnParse will have to be updated accordingly.
